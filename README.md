# 2 Approaches to Source Control Feature Branching

Feature branching is a game-changing aspect of modern software development. Being able to have a developer implement a new feature in a body of code in a safe, independent, isolated manner using Git branching is an overall positive approach to the way companies make software.

Over the years, two techniques of feature branching have emerged. One is what I call _branching from repo_. The other is _branching from fork_. Let’s explore each technique, as well as their benefits and tradeoffs.

## Branching from repo 

Branching from repo is a pattern in which feature branches are created off an existing branch in a business’s repository and then assigned to or assumed by a particular developer for implementation.
